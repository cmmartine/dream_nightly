The professor was a talking owl wearing a tweed jacket, explaining quantum mechanics using floating holograms of dancing particles. Suddenly, the mountain cracked open and revealed a hidden city inside, where everyone communicated through musical notes. I wandered into a library made of crystal and opened a book that played back one of my forgotten memories like a movie. As I tried to leave, the owl stopped me and said, "You havent asked the right question yet."'
